ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   374 out of 126,800    1%

    Number used as Latches:                    287
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        639 out of  63,400    1%
    Number used as logic:                      637 out of  63,400    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             481
      Number using O5 output only:              40
      Number using O5 and O6:                  116
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  19,000    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          922
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           552 out of     922   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 283 out of     922   30%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          87 out of     922    9%
    Number of unique control sets:             155
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             978 out of 126,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       320 out of     210  152% (OVERMAPPED)
